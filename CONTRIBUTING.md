# Contributing

**Thanks!** If you took interest in contributing, you're already awesome. Even
more so now that you came to read these guidelines. In fact, reading through
Testify's code and documents is a free audit that every community member
actively donates to the project and is much appreciated.

**Why?** There should be plenty of work to do, which is why organization is key.
Hopefully this short read will boost the community potential to achieve more and
faster. Infrastructure and Data related technology tends to have slow
development and adoption, but Turbine aims the opposite.

**How?** You can immediately contribute by participating in any of the [current
issues](https://github.com/felixjb/testify/issues), be it by simply giving your
opinion in the discussion or actively solving a problem. All forms of community
interaction are welcomed contributions, so writing blog posts and tutorials or
making citations at presentations and workshops are appreciated too.

**But...** Be sure to also read and respect our
[CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/felixjb/testify/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This guide was adapted from [Turbine project](https://github.com/villasv/turbine).
